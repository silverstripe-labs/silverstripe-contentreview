This module helps with ensuring that a websites content are correct and up-to-date so that visitors 
can rely on the information provided by the client.

For a reviewer this often includes checking links, grammar, factual information and look and feel.


## Roles

There are two types of roles with this module. 

 * Content Owner; are responsible to periodically review a page.
 * Website Responsible; ensures that pages have an scheduled content review with an Content Owner.

## Features

 * Content owner will receive a notification when a pages review date is due with links to the page and the CMS edit form 
 * Content owners can mark a page as 'reviewed' via the CMS Page edit view.
 * Website Responsible can assign a content owner (members or groups) to a page (and optionally all sub-pages) and a schedule of how often the content should be reviewed.
 * Website Responsible can see a “pages due for review” report
 * Website Responsible can see a “pages without content owner” report
 * Website Responsible can set a default Content Owner and schedule for all pages without a review schedule.

## Wished features:

 * Reminder emails that notifies Content Owner and Website responsible that a review is over due.
 * Emails are customisable in the CMS


## Requirements

 * SilverStripe framework and CMS 3.1
 * Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite or MSSQL
 * PHP 5.3 or newer

## Manual installation

Download or clone the source code into the SilverStripe root folder. Rename the module folder
to `contentreview`.

Run dev/build either via the webserver by opening the url `http://<your-host>/dev/build` or 
by running the dev/build via a CLI.

## Composer installation

	composer require silverstripe/contentreview dev-feature_improvements

## Configuration

In order for the contentreview module to send emails, you need to *either*:

 * Setup the DailyTask script to run daily via cron. See framework/tasks/ScheduledTask.php for more information on setup.
 * Install the queuedjobs module, and follow the configuration steps to create a cron job for that module. Once installed, you can just run dev/build to have a job created, which will run at 9am every day by default.

## Usage

To set up a content review schedule the Website responsible needs the permission first. It can be 
set up by and administrator in the Security Admin under the 'Content Permission' for a group.

To set a schedule for a page you need to open the `Settings > Content Review` setting for that page.

CMS users without the permission to change the content review schedule can still see the settings 
and previous reviews in the same view, but cannot change anything.
