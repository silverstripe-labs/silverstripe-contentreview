**Note:** _Govt.nz customisations to this module are as follows_

Prior to the due date, the content review task will send an email to the address configured in the settings.

This email contains two lists:
- a list of pages whose review date is exactly 1 month in the future.
- another list of pages whose review date is exactly 1 week in the future.

Both these times (1 month and 1 week) are defaults only, and can be configured in the settings area.

The email body for these reminder emails is also configurable in the settings.
